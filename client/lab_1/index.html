    <h1>Yuqing Wu Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

    <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

    <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
  <div class = 'section_4'>
    <div class = "text">
    <ul class = "left">
        <li class = "left">HTML and CSS</li>
        <li class = "left">Javascript</li>
        <li class = "left">Node.js</li>
        <li class = "left">And other web development frameworks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</p>

    <ol class ="right">
        <li class = "right">Learn front-end web design</li>
        <li class = "right">Learn new programming languages</li>
        <li class = "right">Learn how to work with others in a technical space</li>
        <li class = "right">Learn popular web dev frameworks</li>
    </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
    <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br/>
       Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
    <p>Add a hard line under here, 
    and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>
    <hr/>

    <h2>Images</h2>

    <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

    <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.gif'width='75'alt='A dancing mochi ball'/>
    <img src='images/mochi.jpg'width='75'alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>
    <img src='images/mochi.png'width='75'alt='A mochi ball'/>
    <img src='images/mochi.svg'width='75'alt='A mochi ball with BÃ©zier handles'/>

    <p><a href='https://github.com/DaveWu96/INST377-Lab-Work'>Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.</a></p>

    <p>If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
